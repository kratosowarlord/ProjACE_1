Processing of cheaper, heavy &amp; high-TAN as well as high-sulphur grades of crude oil was stepped up for better refining margins. <br /><br /> The year 2017-18 marked the commencement of superior BS-VI grade auto fuel supplies from the Company's Mathura and Panipat refineries to the National Capital Territory two years ahead of the scheduled launch across the country by 1st April 2020.</p>
